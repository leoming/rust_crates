# Printers

*Printers* are *host* programs that receive log data, format it and display it.
The following printers are currently available:

- [`probe-run`], parses data sent over RTT (ARM Cortex-M only). NOTE: if you are using the git version of defmt, make sure you also install the tool from git (not crates.io).
- [`defmt-print`], a generic command-line tool that decodes defmt data passed into its standard input.
- [`qemu-run`], parses data sent by QEMU over semihosting (ARM Cortex-M only). NOTE: used for internal testing; won't be published to crates.io
